        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="largeText">
                Son Wukong is a character from Chinese Mythology known as the "Monkey King".
                He is known for his unruly behavior as well as immense powers and vast array of
                abilities. This individual, born from a magical rock at the top of a mountain
                was a powerful magical monkey demon who was even able to shake heaven itself,
                being one of the primary menaces towards the gods.
            </p>
        <h2>Appearence</h2>
            <p class="largeText">
                Wukong has the appearence of a normal macaque however, he does have the ability to
                transform into 72 different things and thus his appearence is maleable. After
                becoming a warrior and going through his trials and tribulations, Wukong is often
                depicted as wearing golden armor with iconic pheonix feathers running from his
                helment as well as holding his golden staff "Ru Yi".

        <h2>Pop Culture</h2>
            <p class="largeText">
                Wukong has made a variety of appearences in pop culture, while not treated as a
                true mythological figure by Buddist and Taoists, he has made a huge number of
                appearences in TV, movies and plays. Perhaps some of the most notable appearences
                in recent times can include Journey to the West, a famous Chinese film, DragonBall,
                a famous anime as well as having a very much adapted version in God of High
