                    abilities. This individual, born from a magical rock at the top of a mountain 
                    was a powerful magical monkey demon who was even able to shake heaven itself,

                <h2>Appearence</h2>
                <p class="largeText">
                    Wukong has the appearence of a normal macaque however, he does have the ability to
                    transform into 72 different things and thus his appearence is maleable. After
                    becoming a warrior and going through his trials and tribulations, Wukong is often
                    depicted as wearing golden armor with iconic pheonix feathers running from his
                    helment as well as holding his golden staff "Ru Yi".
