                <h4>Tang Sanzang</h4>
                <p class="largeText">
                    Tan Sanzang was the master and teacher of Wukong. Being one of the only inviduals
                    that Wukong actually respects, he is one of the only individuals that is able to
                    control the untempered rage that Wukong had as well as teach him to be a better
                    individual. Tang himself rescued Wukong from the mountain that Buddha pinned him
                    with. After joining him as a discipline, Wukong learned from Tang's teachings, 
                    even while controlled by a circlet, however after their Journey to India, Wukong
                    was able to achieve enlightenment.

                <h4>Jade Emperor</h4>
                <p class="largeText">
                    Wukong had a poor relationship with the Jade emperor. Given that the emperor did
                    not respect the power of the Monkey king, he gave the monkey king the lowliest job
                    in heaven and even after the monkey king demonstrated his power, did not treat him
                    as he treated other gods and thus, the monkey king wrecked havok in heaven. It was
                    only through the power of Buddha that he was able to get the monkey king under
                    control. Though this releationship is depicted differently in different forms media
                    the jade emperor typically is shown to have some degree of fear regarding the monkey
                    king.

                <h4>Buddha</h4>
                <p class="largeText">
                    The only being to truely defeat the monkey King, Buddha is more of a omnipotent 
                    in these stories. Given his immense power, Buddha sees the monkey king as a mostly 
                    interesting little child and does not hesitate to punish him as such.
